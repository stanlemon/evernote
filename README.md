# Evernote OAuth Example
This code is intended to illustrate how to conect to Evernote OAuth using Guzzle and then make a basic request for retrieivng a list of notebooks and the notes contained in them.

The Evernote SDK and Guzzle library are loaded via composer and each fall under their respective licenses.  The example code is originally based off of the 'sample' included with the Evernote SDK and is intended for use by anyone interested in integrating with Evernote using PHP.
